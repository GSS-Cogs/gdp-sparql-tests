### Review of IC SPARQL tests in /tests/qb.

Status as of: 24/02/2021

Data Cube tests have been reverted back to the original ICs, modulo replacing ASK with SELECT and adding some alternate
property paths to use specific properties as well as super-properties and some optimisations.

IC-12, IC-16 and IC-17 are currently disabled as they're too expensive.
